# spibone - Wishbone over SPI

The ability to bridge Wishbone is an incredibly powerful one.  However, the various bridges can be rather heavy in terms of resource usage.  This presents a simple bridge that operates over SPI.

## Usage

The Wishbone bus should go in a clock domain that's roughly 4x that of your clock signal.  For example, if your clock signal is 12 MHz, place the bridge in a 48 MHz domain.  Finally, add the bridge to your `SoCCore`:

```python
class BaseSoC(SoCCore):
    def __init__(self, platform, **kwargs):
        ...
        # Add SPI
        spi_pads = platform.request("spi")
        self.submodules.spibone = ClockDomainsRenamer("clk_48")(spibone.SpiWishboneBridge(spi_pads))
        self.add_wb_master(self.spibone.wishbone)
```
